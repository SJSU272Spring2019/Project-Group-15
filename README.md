<b>Sustainable Food Waste Management<b>


Sustainable Food Waste Management is a webbased application designed to help feed the hungry across
shelter homes by collecting surplus fit-to-eat food from
restaurants. To start with, restaurants can sign up on this
website and let us know what type of food and their quantity,
quality etc. they want to donate. Next up, the volunteers can
register on our website, who voluntarily would collect food
from restaurants and deliver it to shelter homes.
